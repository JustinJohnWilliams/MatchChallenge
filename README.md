Match.com Automated QA Challenge
Create a Selenium Webdriver script written in any language (preferably in Java, C# or F#)
# The script should be able to run against Firefox and Chrome browsers
# The script should do the following:
1. Register a new user on match.com
2. Verify the user is Signed-in.
3. Run a search to find users and add at least one user as a favorite.
4. Sign out the user and verify that the user is signed out.
5. Sign in again and verify that the user can see his/her favorited user (from step 3).
